# 5 Stage Pipelined Architecture
The LC-3b simulator is a C program that implements a 5-stage piplined microarchitecture of the LC-3b computer architecture. The simulator itself is a modified version of Professor Yale Patt’s course at UT Austin, but each stage of the pipeline was programmed myself. The simulator is designed to efficiently and accurately process assembly instructions to update the state of the machine. In addition, the simulator’s design allows it to easily add on additional features such as virtual memory and multilevel caching.
